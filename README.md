# Kitty Terminal Emulator

Out of all of the various terminal emulators I chose Kitty for a couple main reasons. 

1. Very easy to configure.
    i.  Font Installation is painless.
    ii. Theme Installation is painless.
2. Extensibility
    i.  Kitty has a bunch of built in extensions called kittens. 
    ii. Theme and font installations are super easy thanks to these.
3. Works On macOS and Linux
    i.  I work professionally using macOS, and personally in Linux. (I do have Windows and use it from time to time bit eh). 
    So being able to have the same configuration on each system, with the same theme, and font is super helpful to me. Reduces distractions and just makes me feel better.
